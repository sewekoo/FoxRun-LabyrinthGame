- Implemented weave labyrinth generation successfully with placeholder graphics.
	- Red blocks represent walls (small gaps should be ignored. Those are due to draw order of walls and some of them being black when they are "broken" instead of invisible)
	- Black represent roads
	- Green blocks represent bridges or overpasses over a square
- There were some problems that made me change a plan a bit. For example Vectors did not obviously work because I needed mutable collections so I changed to Buffers.
- Then I couldn't implement a "Window" -class yet like I wanted, because how the JavaFX works. I will look into this further on and for now implement graphical elements in Main object.
- I think I'm pretty much on schedule. I will now begin work with game loop and adding ability to move a character in the labyrinth.
- Even though graphically my project is quite ugly, I should be able to implement game loop and work on graphics later on.
- Estimated work hours for last two weeks are around 10 hours.
